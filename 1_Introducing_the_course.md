#Lesson 1: Introducing the course
Welcome to Beginner's web development. This course aims to teach you a little bit about how the web works and how to create content for it, and get you excited about technology in general. 

## Why is the Web interesting?
The Web is possibly the most revolutionary invention of our time, as the following  slideshow explains:

## Why is the web a good thing?
We've already looked at some of the advantages above, but think about it again:

* Games, information, research, communication, publishing, entertainment, shopping, friends, jobs, professopnal services ...
* The Web can provide most things you need (except sunshine and exercise.)
* Web developers can create sites and applications that can be accessed instantly by any device with a web browser.
* In some parts of the world the web is the only available uncensored source of news and self-expression.
* The web is built on open standards — technologies that are free to use and aren't owned or controlled by one single company. This means that it is developed for the good of humanity, not the profit or power of one single person or organization.

## How the web works
The technologies that the Web is built on were originally created as part of a US military project called ARPANET, which aimed to create a system for storing and sharing documents between military/government departments.

The Web is the stuff that Tim Berners Lee and the W3C built on top of that technology stack — HTML, hyperlinks, web servers.

## E-safety
The Web is a brilliant thing, but it is also fraught with danger:

* Social networking sites can be used to bully or abuse people.
* People use sneaky tactics such as "Phishing" to steal people's personal details.
* If you post your personal details online, such as your real address, people could find you and cause you harm.

You can stay safe with some simple rules:

1. Never share your surname, real address, bank account details, or other such personal details online. Don't share your friends' or family members' details online either.
2. Don't post embarrassing pictures or information about yourself or others online, or send them to anyone. Once in a digital format, information can be copied and passed around endlessly. And it will hang around forever.
3. If someone starts to make you feel uncomfortable online, e.g. by threatening you or saying nasty tnings, immediately stop talking to them, take a screenshot of the messages, then tell your parents about it. Your parents can then sort it out by telling your school or the police, whatever is most appropriate.
4. If you receive messages or emails from people you don't know, don't respond to them or follow any instructions they may ask you to carry out. They might redirect you to a phishing site, or direct you download a virus-infected file.


## Hacking the web with X-ray Goggles
Let's round off this lesson with a bit of fun. We'll use a tool called Xray goggles to explore the school website, see what makes it up, and show how you can start changing content.
