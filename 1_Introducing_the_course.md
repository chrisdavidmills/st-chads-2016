#Lesson 1: Introducing the course
Welcome to Beginner's web development. This course aims to teach you a little bit about how the web works and how to create content for it, and get you excited about technology in general. 

## Why is the Web interesting?
The Web is possibly the most revolutionary invention of our time, [as this slideshow explains](http://slides.com/chrisdavidmills/what-is-the-web#/).

## Why is the web a good thing?
We've already looked at some of the advantages above, but think about it again:

* Games, information, research, communication, publishing, entertainment, shopping, friends, jobs, professopnal services ...
* The Web can provide most things you need (except sunshine and exercise.)
* Web developers can create sites and applications that can be accessed instantly by any device with a web browser.
* In some parts of the world the web is the only available uncensored source of news and self-expression.
* The web is built on open standards — technologies that are free to use and aren't owned or controlled by one single company. This means that it is developed for the good of humanity, not the profit or power of one single person or organization.

## How the web works
The technologies that the Web is built on were originally created as part of a US military project called ARPANET, which aimed to create a system for storing and sharing documents between military/government departments.

The Web is the stuff that Tim Berners Lee and the W3C built on top of that technology stack — HTML, hyperlinks, web servers.

The Web is built on a series of technologies for information transfer, plus some programming languages that you use to specify how you want that information to look. A simplified view follows:

* The client: This is your computer at home, which you use to access the Web
* The server: This is a computer sat in a room somewhere, which stores websites. When you access a website on your computer, a copy of the website data is sent from the server to your client machine for you to look at.
* Your Internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the Web. It's basically like a giant street that cars and people can travel down.
* TCP/IP: Defines how your data should travel down that road. This is like the cars and buses people use to get places.
* HTTP: Defines how and when data should be sent between the client and the server. This is like some people deciding what journeys they need to go on down the road, how far they need to travel, what mode of transport they need to use, etc.
* DNS: Domain Name Servers are like an address book for Websites. When you type in a web address in your browser, before the website is retrieved the browser goes to the DNS to find out where it lives, like when you look up someone's address so you can go and visit them. Try typing 172.217.4.35 into your web browser.
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript: The main three programming languages that websites are built from.
* Assets: This is a collective noun for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as image files, MP3s and videos, Word documents, PDFs, etc.


## E-safety
The Web is a brilliant thing, but it is also fraught with danger:

* Social networking sites can be used to bully or abuse people.
* People use sneaky tactics such as "Phishing" to steal people's personal details.
* If you post your personal details online, such as your real address, people could find you and cause you harm.

You can stay safe with some simple rules:

1. Never share your surname, real address, bank account details, or other such personal details online. Don't share your friends' or family members' details online either.
2. Don't post embarrassing pictures or information about yourself or others online, or send them to anyone. Once in a digital format, information can be copied and passed around endlessly. And it will hang around forever.
3. If someone starts to make you feel uncomfortable online, e.g. by threatening you or saying nasty tnings, immediately stop talking to them, take a screenshot of the messages, then tell your parents about it. Your parents can then sort it out by telling your school or the police, whatever is most appropriate.
4. If you receive messages or emails from people you don't know, don't respond to them or follow any instructions they may ask you to carry out. They might redirect you to a phishing site, or direct you download a virus-infected file.


## Hacking the web with X-ray Goggles
Let's round off this lesson with a bit of fun. We'll use a tool called Xray goggles to explore the school website, see what makes it up, and show how you can start changing content.

We'll round off this week with a first look at some web code, via an application called [Xray Goggles](https://goggles.mozilla.org/).

* Click on the above link.
* On this page, click the X-Ray Goggles button. You'll see that now as you move your mouse pointer around the page, the different parts of the page highlight to tell you what code is underneath each bit.
* Click some text on the page: A window will open up allowing you to edit the page!
* Change the text of the title to something else.
* Click the "Commit changes" button: you'll now see that the page has been changed.
* You can also press delete/backspace to delete bits of the webpage, and P to publish your hacked version of the page!
* Play with the page for a few minutes, then turn Xray Goggles off by pressing Esc.
    You can make Xray Goggles available on any page by putting it on your browser: You can drag the "Drag and drop me in your bookmark bar" button onto your bookmarks toolbar, or add it to your bookmarks menu.

Note: You have only changed your own copy of the web page, not the original on the server. If you reload the page (Ctrl + R or Cmd + R on Mac) you'll see that the page returns to its original state.
Hacking the school website

Let's load up the [school website](http://www.stchads.oldham.sch.uk/) and have a go at changing that. Once you've finished, you can publish your remixed version of the web page at it's own web address by pressing P.
