How search engines work
-----------------------

Google (and other search engines) have web crawlers (or spiders) â€” applications that crawl the web and index pages in a way that is easily searchable by the search engines themselves. For example Google has Googlebot, Bing has Bingbot...

These apps:

* load new web pages 
* Find their useful information/keywords/headings/links.
* then they do the same to pages they are linking
* And pages they are linking, and so on.
* They also recheck pages after a certain amount of time.

Search engines can then search this index to find the most relevant resuls to pull up for any search term.

--------------------

What counts positively towards search rank?

1.

Keywords - e.g. if your site is about dogs, they look for "dog", "breeding", "labrador", "doberman", "puppies", "care", "feeding", etc.

Keep keywords consistent. Stick to a consistent tagline that says it all. Get everyone to use that tagline, e.g. Nike "Just do it"

These words are more potent if used in headings, links, bolded text, etc

<h1>Dog breeding</h1>

<p>Find more out about <a href="labradors.html">Owning Labradors</a>.</p>

<p>Popular dog breeds include <strong>Labradors</strong>, <strong>Dobermans</strong>, and <strong>Poodles</strong>.</p>

2. 

Lots of good traffic to and from your site. If lots of other high ranking, relevant sites link to you, and you link to other such sites, that is a good thing. Social media is important here.

This is why spammers try put spam links on big sites.

3. 

Does your site load quickly

4. 

Does it work well on mobiles and other devices

5. 

Does the site have a good user experience. Not loaded with ads, easy to get around, varied and interesting content (having images and video counts positively.)

6.

Are your domains consistent? www.mysite.com, versus mysite.com or mysite.co.uk?

7.

Metadata

Most metadata is useless these days because of abuse by keyword spammers, but it is still useful to have some meta data present - some of it is used in results pages.

-----------------

What counts negatively?

1.

Keyword spam

in pages, and in metadata, e.g. the keyword meta tag.

<meta name="keywords" content="FAR TOO MUCH STUFF!!!">

2.

Bad user experience

3.

Sponsored links

Google knows all ;-)

4. Bad content

-----------------

Stopping web crawlers

You can add code to your website to limit the amount of information indexed, for example:

<meta name="Googlebot" content="nofollow" />

or by using robots.txt (the robot exclusion policy), which looks something like this:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
Disallow: /notes/
Disallow: /diary/


* == 'wild card'

You can also use nofollow on specific links

<a href="www.annoyingsite.com" rel="nofollow">Spam link</a>

Cite MDN spam example (lots of traffic good for SEO.)

Why would you not want your content indexed? It might be out of date, or wrong, or embarrassing. This brings us towards the subject of esafety - anything you put online will be there pretty much forever, unless you do something about it (and you may not be able to.)

Think carefully before you put things online.

Cite MDN archives section as a good example

Wide range of search tools

web page like google.co.uk
app on mobile device
in-browser search tool

------------------------------------

Recognising trustworthy sources - is it the truth? Is it valid? Is it a spam site? Is it legit?

Check date
Some sites are obviously trustworthy, e.g. bbc.co.uk
Sites are top of rankings = more trustworthy
check the URL is correct
check for phishing sites - e.g. ask for whole password? Link in email from trustworthy source.
check for https in the web site address
look for trust certificates, e.g. verisign
do they use popular partner sites such as paypal or google for payments.
Look for reviews of the site.
Search for "example.com scam"
