#Notes
* The course this year will teach similar subject matter (e.g. HTML/CSS/Web mechanics basics, with some other stuff thrown in, such as seach engine usage and e-safety.)
* But there will be some slightly different approaches this time:
	* Previous years relied a lot on comprehensive notes; this year will rely less on notes and more on  close following of classroom instruction.
	* At each stage every student will do exactly the same steps, and we will build up towards creating a website about something we are in to. In each case it will be the same structure, but the content and style will vary.
	* Students who grasp the instructions more quickly will be encouraged to help/mentor the slower students, which is rewarding for both parties.
	* There will be no youtube this time around. This was way too much of a distraction last time.
	* e-safety should feature, as in previous years.

## Proposed course outline
1. Intro, why is web good, how the web works, x-ray goggles, e-safety
2. Getting familiar with your tool; html/css intro
3. HTML basics, anatomy of an HTML document, write your basic text content = headings, p, ul/ol/li
4. Images and links
5. CSS basics, anatomy, selectors, different ways of applying CSS
6. let's style our text, fonts, color, web fonts
7. backgrounds, boxes, borders, box model
8. layout - centering our image, doing a 2 column layout
9. Decorations and fun stuff (optional lesson if we get time at the end.)

##Research on GUI tool for course
We tried Thimble and JSBin in the past. Accounts were a pain for both in the past, with the school having to create multiple emails, usernames, pwds, etc. for the students. But I think this is unavoidable. It would be great if we could find a tool that allows the teacher to create a master account that all the students can then use to log in.

Options:

* [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/): It's my favourite one of these tools, but it does require a separate login for each student, and students sometimes got confused about how to save their work, resulting in lost work.
* [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/): The new Mozilla Thimble looks like a strong contender; it has fixed many of the problems the previous one had (such as not having a separate pane for HTML/CSS), but it still requires separate logins/passwords.
* [Codepen](http://codepen.io): Very popular amongst the web developer crowd for sharing experiments, but a bit less beginner friendly than the others, less easy to publish your work and view just the work (e.g. publish your website), and still requires logins.
* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/): One of the older offerings available, still pretty darn good. But pretty geeky and not very beginner friendly.

## Year 6 lessons
There is a shift in the computer curriculum towards comp sci, and Claire is expected to teach some new stuff to her year 6 classes, and she thinks I can help her. Each one of the following would need to be taught in a half hour session.

###How search engines work

* How a search engine works
* SEO - what counts positively and negatively towards search rank
* Interesting search tricks

Outcomes:

1. how search engines order their search results
2. learn advanced features, like date searching, image searching
3. Use a range of search tools
4. Recognising trustworthy sources - is it the truth? Is it valid? Is it a spam site? Is it legit?

###How the internet works
* Brief history - start by asking who invented the internet, and the Web
* Use familiar terms, such as Algorithm, Debugging, Server, client
* Introduce other terms, such as packets, hosts, DNS
* Work out a decent diagram to share

Outcomes to understand:

1. The Internet is a large network
2. Understand that data can be shared and copied (esafety, copyright, plagiarism)
3. Understand role of servers, e.G. Print servers, file sharing servers, web servers
4. Use internet to share data with another person - show different services
5. Understand how computers are able to communicate and share information - talk about dialup, wired, (briefly), then talk about wifi networks, etc.
6. Use and combine services on t'internet to share information - google docs?
